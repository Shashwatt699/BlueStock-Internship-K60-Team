-Overview

This repository documents the planning, team structure, and initial development work for the internship project at BlueStock, conducted with a group of 10 interns. The project was intended to be developed collaboratively using modern full-stack technologies.

Although the final product was not completed due to lack of mentorship and limited team coordination, this repo showcases the team setup, tech stack planning, and my personal contributions to frontend setup using React + Tailwind CSS.


My Contributions

- Took initiative as Team Co-Lead to structure and organize a 10-member team.
- Conducted team meetings and divided members into tech stacks based on expertise.
- Set up the frontend boilerplate using React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.
- Drafted a basic landing page to reflect the design direction of the project.

Tech Stack Options (Initial Team Poll)

To match intern preferences and allow freedom of contribution, we created two groups based on stack choices:

Group 1 – Python Stack
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python Django

Group 2 – JavaScript Stack
- Frontend: Angular + Bootstrap
- Backend: Node.js + Express

Interns were encouraged to choose based on their skills and interest.
