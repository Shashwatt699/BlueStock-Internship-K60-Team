Initial Team Structure & Stack Poll

Group 1 – Python Stack
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python Django

Group 2 – JavaScript Stack
- Frontend: Angular + Bootstrap
- Backend: Node.js + Express

Team members can contribute to the stack they'd be most comfortable contributing to. The idea is to let interns self-assign to groups based on their comfort with tools and frameworks.
